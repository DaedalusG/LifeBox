## LifeBox Overview
LifeBox is a platform meant for exploring and sharing ideas about Conways Game of Life. The Game of Life is a set of rules applied to a grid on cells, populated or unpopulated. Although the rules are simple and deterministic, the grids behavior over iterations of the rules is fundementally unpredictable. For this reason Conways Game of Life is a classic visual representation of a complex system. 

Complexity and Chaos Theory are concepts I wasn't exposed to until college, but, the philosophical implications of complexity and emergence in systems, would have been inspirational to me in my adolesence. LifeBox was inspired as a way to give k-12 educators a way to get kids talking about the weirdness of mathematics with a simple and playful tool. 

Users of LifeBox may create a profile and begin creating and saving to LifeBox initial conditions of a grid. Users can then comment on grids and search the app for grids other users have created. A minimal set of instructions is provided, and in the future more features to gamify the app may be added.
